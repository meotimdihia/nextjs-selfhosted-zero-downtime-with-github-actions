# How to Deploy a Self-Hosted Next.js App on a Server with Near Zero Downtime

(Achieving true zero downtime is difficultâ€”I still havenâ€™t found a simple way to do it.)

While big corporations or large companies can hire a team to deploy Next.js using Docker, for a startup or individual developer with limited experience in Docker, this guide provides a simple method to deploy Next.js with near zero downtime.

# 1. Use PM2

I think you can use PM2 with Capistrano-like deployments to handle this problem. However, I havenâ€™t tested it yet because PM2 monkey-patches logs, which is inappropriate in my case.

# 2. Use systemd

This method is very simple, but troubleshooting issues may be difficult if you lack experience.

I used this GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a full website serving 50,000 active users simultaneously.

How It Works:
	1.	Create multiple systemd services such as project.service, project2.service, etc.
	2.	The number of services depends on how large your website isâ€”you will need more as your traffic grows.
	3.	When deploying a new version, swap the directory and restart services to ensure minimal downtime.

You can find more details in the full workflow file: `.github/workflows/main.yml`

``` shell
# Copy the .env file from the old directory to the new one
cp -R /home/meotimdihia/sources/project/.env /home/meotimdihia/sources/project3/.env

# Stop all instances
sudo systemctl stop project2 project3 project4

# Rename the old project directory as a backup
mv /home/meotimdihia/sources/project /home/meotimdihia/sources/project2

# Replace the old directory with the newly deployed version
cp -R /home/meotimdihia/sources/project3/. /home/meotimdihia/sources/project/

# Start all instances
sudo systemctl start project project2 project3 project4

# Since you are using a self-hosted setup, you need to clear the CDN cache
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/2d75d17485a663129e45e83a853aede1/purge_cache" \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: youremail@gmail.com" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_KEY }}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"files":["https://yourdomain.io", "https://yourdomain.io/home?utm_source=web_app_manifest", "https://yourdomain.io/sw.js", "https://yourdomain.io/api/get-build-id"]}'

# Now you can delete the old version.
# Why do we delete it as the last step? Because this directory is very large when using self-hosting.
# In my case, it can grow up to 200GB.
rm -rf /home/meotimdihia/sources/project2
```
